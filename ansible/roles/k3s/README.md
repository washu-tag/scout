# k3s Role

This role installs and configures [k3s](https://k3s.io/) - a lightweight Kubernetes distribution - on target nodes. It supports both online (internet-connected) and air-gapped (offline) deployment modes.

## Role Variables

See [Creating the Ansible Inventory File](../../../docs/source/technical/inventory.md#k3s) and [Air-Gapped Deployment](../../../docs/source/technical/air-gapped.md#air-gapped-configuration-variables) for user-configurable variables.

**Key variables for developers:**
- `k3s_artifact_temp_dir`: Computed at runtime - temporary directory on control node for artifacts
- `k3s_install_script_path`: Computed as `{{ k3s_bin_dir }}/get.k3s.io.sh`
- `use_staging_node`: Internal flag set when air-gapped mode is enabled and staging host exists
- `staging_harbor_host`: Computed from staging node Harbor configuration
- `registry_config_changed`: Tracks whether registry mirrors have changed (triggers k3s restart)

See `defaults/main.yaml` for complete variable definitions and defaults.

## Dependencies

- `scout_common` role (for Helm chart deployment patterns)
- `harbor` role variables (for air-gapped registry mirror configuration)

## Usage

See [Creating the Ansible Inventory File](../../../docs/source/technical/inventory.md) and [Air-Gapped Deployment](../../../docs/source/technical/air-gapped.md) for complete configuration examples and deployment instructions.

## Task Organization

The role is organized into focused task files:

- `main.yaml`: Orchestration - coordinates all installation steps
- `prerequisites.yaml`: Common setup for all nodes
- `artifacts.yaml`: Handles artifact download for air-gapped mode
- `download_selinux_rpms.yaml`: Kubernetes Job for SELinux package download
- `selinux.yaml`: SELinux package installation
- `registry.yaml`: Harbor registry mirror configuration
- `server.yaml`: k3s server (control plane) installation
- `agent.yaml`: k3s agent (worker) installation
- `gpu.yaml`: GPU worker configuration

## Testing

This role includes Molecule integration tests that perform actual k3s installation in Docker containers:

```bash
cd ansible/roles/k3s
# Requires Docker and molecule-plugins[docker]
uvx --with molecule-plugins[docker] molecule test -s integration
```

**What the tests do:**
- Spin up Rocky Linux 9 container with systemd support
- Install k3s server using the role
- Verify k3s systemd service is active
- Verify k3s cluster is responsive (`kubectl get nodes`)
- Verify node reaches Ready state
- Check kubeconfig file generation and permissions

**Why integration tests (not unit tests):**
The k3s role performs system-level operations (systemd service management, privileged installation, Kubernetes cluster creation) that cannot be meaningfully mocked. Integration tests validate real installation behavior including systemd integration and cluster health.

**Limitations:**
- Tests require Docker daemon with privileged container support
- Air-gapped mode testing requires pre-staged artifacts (not yet implemented)
- Multi-node scenarios are tested in CI with real deployments
- Tests take 2-5 minutes (vs seconds for unit tests)
