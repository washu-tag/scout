# DCM4CHEE PACS

This chart defines the deployment of the minimum services of [dcm4chee-arc-light](https://github.com/dcm4che/dcm4chee-arc-light/wiki/Run-minimum-set-of-archive-services-on-a-single-host)
and is configured with Ansible as an optional part of a standard Scout installation. As of right now, the deployment only works when deployed at the root of the server, so it is not
compatible with running superset at the same time.

The following variables are required to be set:
`dcm4chee_namespace`: Kubernetes namespace for all DCM4CHEE resources.
`dcm4chee_dir`: Base directory on the local file system to use for all volume mounts for DCM4CHEE pods.
`dcm4chee_dicom_port`: Port on which DIMSE services will be exposed.

The following variables all have default values if not provided in your inventory file:
`dcm4chee_timezone`: Timezone string to be included in DCM4CHEE containers. Defaults to `America/Chicago`.
`dcm4chee_arc_version`: Version of the [archive image](https://github.com/dcm4che-dockerfiles/dcm4chee-arc-psql) to deploy.
`dcm4chee_db_version`: Version of the [db image](https://github.com/dcm4che-dockerfiles/postgres-dcm4chee) to deploy.
`dcm4chee_ldap_version`: Version of the [Slapd image](https://github.com/dcm4che-dockerfiles/slapd-dcm4chee) to deploy.
`dcm4chee_wildfly_storage_size`: Size of the PV available for wildfly in the archive container. Defaults to `10Gi`.
`dcm4chee_storage_storage_size`: Size of the PV available for storage (primarily for DICOM) within archive container. Defaults to `10Gi`.
`dcm4chee_db_storage_size`: Size of the PV available for postgres within the database container. Defaults to `10Gi`.
`dcm4chee_openldap_storage_size`: Size of the PV available for openldap data within the Slapd container. Defaults to `10Gi`.
`dcm4chee_slapd_storage_size`: Size of the PV available for Slapd within the Slapd container. Defaults to `10Gi`.
`dcm4chee_db`: Name of the (postgres) database to use for DCM4CHEE. Defaults to `pacsdb`.
`dcm4chee_db_user`: Username for the database account. Defaults to `pacs`.
`dcm4chee_db_password`: Password for the database account. Defaults to `pacs`.

The following variables are fully optional and can be omitted entirely:
`dcm4chee_populate`: The path on the local disk to use for a job to send data to the PACS. If the variable is not defined,
the populate job will be skipped. Otherwise, it will be created as an async job to populate the PACS from the provided
directory.
