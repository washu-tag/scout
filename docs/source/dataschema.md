# Data Schema

The Scout Rad Report Explorer is backed by [Delta Lake](https://delta.io/) and [MinIO](https://min.io/) to store 
and manage HL7 radiology reports and other data and metadata. There is one main table that contains the report data. 
Below is a description of the report table schema and the mapping of HL7 fields to the report table columns. Note that 
some fields are derived from others, and some fields may not be directly mapped to HL7 fields.

| Column Name                        | HL7 Report Field | Data Type      | Nullable | Description/Notes                                                                                                                    |

The `patient_id_json` column contains a JSON representation of all patient identifiers associated with the report.

An example of the JSON representation is shown below:

```json
[
  {
    "id_number": "ABC9587720",
    "assigning_authority": "ABC",
    "identifier_type_code": "MR"
  },
  {
    "id_number": "EPIC11381864",
    "assigning_authority": "EPIC",
    "identifier_type_code": "MRN"
  }
]
```

The assigning authority and identifier type code are used to create separate columns for each patient ID type to
facilitate easier querying and analysis. For example, the `epic_mrn` column is created from the assigning authority 
"EPIC" and identifier type code "MRN". The same applies to other patient ID columns.
