# Authentication

Scout uses single sign-on (SSO) authentication to provide secure access to all services.

## Logging In

Scout is connected to your institutional identity provider (IdP) and uses SSO for authentication. 
When you access any Scout service, you will be automatically redirected to the login page if you 
are not already authenticated.

## User Registration & Approval

When you log in for the first time:

1. **Account Creation**: Your user account is automatically created in Scout when you authenticate with your institutional IdP
2. **Pending Approval**: New users must be approved by a Scout administrator before accessing services
3. **Email Notification**: Scout administrators receive an email notification when a new user registers
4. **Administrator Action**: An administrator will review and approve your access request
5. **Access Granted**: An email notification will be sent to you once approved, and you can then access Scout services

You will see a "Registration Pending" message if you attempt to access Scout services before being approved.

Once approved, you can access all [Scout services](services.md) with a single login.
