# Architecture Decision Record: Air-Gapped Helm Chart Deployment

**Status**: Accepted - Implementation In Progress
**Date**: 2025-10-08 (Proposed), 2025-10-10 (Accepted)
**Decision Owner**: Scout Platform Team
**Related Documents**:
- `staging-node-implementation-plan.md` (Harbor container registry)
- `air-gapped-helm-implementation-plan.md` (Implementation details)

## Context

Scout deployments need to support air-gapped Kubernetes clusters where worker nodes cannot directly access the internet. We've implemented Harbor on a staging node to proxy container images. The remaining challenge is Helm chart deployment.

### Current State

Scout uses 18 Helm charts across its deployment:

**Public Charts (12):**
- cert-manager (jetstack)
- cass-operator (k8ssandra)
- Temporal (temporalio)
- JupyterHub (jupyterhub)
- Superset (apache)
- Trino (trinodb)
- MinIO Operator + Tenant (min.io)
- Loki (grafana)
- Promtail (grafana)
- Grafana (grafana)
- Prometheus (prometheus-community)
- GPU Operator (nvidia)
- Harbor (goharbor)

**Local Charts (6):**
- explorer
- hl7log-extractor
- hl7-transformer
- hive-metastore
- dcm4chee
- orthanc

### Requirements

1. **Air-gapped deployment**: Worker nodes cannot access internet
2. **Control node access**: Ansible control node (localhost) can access internet and has Scout repository
3. **Backward compatibility**: Non-air-gapped deployments must continue working
4. **Operational simplicity**: Minimize maintenance overhead for staging node infrastructure

### Constraints

- Harbor container registry deployed on staging node
- Harbor ChartMuseum deprecated; OCI registry support is current standard
- Most public Helm charts use HTTP-based repositories, not OCI registries
- No requirement for `helm rollback` or `helm history` features
- Temporal workflow relies on manually waiting for schema migration job (already implemented)

## Decision

**We will use local chart rendering for ALL Helm deployments in air-gapped environments.**

### Implementation Pattern

1. **Control node** (localhost with internet access):
   - Adds Helm repositories for public charts (internet access available)
   - Renders charts using `helm template` with deployment-specific values
   - Generates plain Kubernetes YAML manifests

2. **Air-gapped cluster**:
   - Receives pre-rendered YAML manifests from control node
   - Applies manifests using `kubectl apply` or `kubernetes.core.k8s` Ansible module
   - Pulls container images through Harbor registry mirrors (already configured)

3. **Mode selection**:
   - `use_staging_node: false` → Use `kubernetes.core.helm` module (current behavior)
   - `use_staging_node: true` → Use local rendering + k8s apply (new behavior)

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: OCI Registry for All Charts

**How it works**: Cache all Helm charts in Harbor's OCI registry, deploy from Harbor

**Pros**:
- Single source of truth for both container images and charts
- Retains Helm release management (rollback, history, upgrades)
- Helm hooks execute correctly

**Cons**:
- ❌ **Critical blocker**: Most public charts are NOT available as OCI artifacts
  - Would require staging node to run `helm pull` → `helm push` for each chart
  - 10+ public charts to maintain and keep in sync with upstream
- ❌ **Operational overhead**: Chart version synchronization, caching infrastructure
- ❌ **Complexity**: Harbor OCI support is newer, less mature than HTTP-based repos
- ✅ **Not needed**: We don't use `helm rollback` or `helm history`

**Verdict**: Rejected due to operational complexity and lack of value-add

### Alternative 2: Hybrid Approach (OCI for Local, Rendering for Public)

**How it works**:
- Public charts → Local rendering
- Local charts → GitHub Container Registry

**Pros**:
- Avoids public chart caching complexity
- Retains Helm features for Scout-controlled charts
- Natural CI/CD integration for local charts

**Cons**:
- ⚠️ **Inconsistent patterns**: Two different deployment methods to maintain
- ⚠️ **Limited benefit**: Our local charts are simple, don't use advanced Helm features
- ⚠️ **Added complexity**: CI/CD must package and push local charts to GHCR
- ✅ **Not needed**: We don't need Helm rollback for local charts either

**Verdict**: Rejected in favor of consistent approach

### Alternative 3: Local Rendering for All Charts (SELECTED)

**How it works**: Render all charts on localhost, apply manifests to cluster

**Pros**:
- ✅ **Universal compatibility**: Works with HTTP repos, OCI, local paths
- ✅ **Operational simplicity**: No chart caching infrastructure needed
- ✅ **Leverages existing access**: Control node already has internet access
- ✅ **Backward compatible**: Easy to toggle via `use_staging_node` flag
- ✅ **Proven pattern**: Many air-gapped deployments use this approach

**Cons**:
- ❌ **Lost Helm features**: No rollback, no release history, no `--reuse-values`
- ❌ **Helm hooks don't execute**: Pre-install, post-upgrade hooks skipped

**Why cons are acceptable**:
1. **Rollback/history**: Confirmed not used in Scout deployments
2. **Helm hooks analysis** (from Temporal chart inspection):
   - Test hooks (`helm.sh/hook: test-success`) → Only run with `helm test` (never used)
   - Pre-install ServiceAccount hook → Ordering optimization only, not functionally required
   - Schema migration job → Not a hook, already handled manually in playbook
3. **Workarounds exist**: Complex scenarios (Temporal schema) already handled with manual waits

**Verdict**: SELECTED - Best balance of simplicity and functionality

## Rationale

### Why Local Rendering Wins

1. **Public chart reality**:
   - All 10 public charts use HTTP-based repositories
   - Converting to OCI would require maintaining parallel infrastructure
   - No operational benefit gained (we don't use rollback/history)

2. **Operational simplicity**:
   - No staging node chart caching to maintain
   - No chart version synchronization
   - No Harbor OCI configuration complexity
   - Fewer moving parts = more reliable deployments

3. **Leverages existing access patterns**:
   - Ansible control node already has internet access
   - Ansible control node already has Scout repository (for local charts)
   - Harbor staging node only needs to proxy container images (already working)

4. **Helm features unused**:
   - `helm rollback`: Confirmed not used
   - `helm history`: Confirmed not used
   - Helm hooks: Analysis shows non-critical for Scout deployments

5. **Backward compatibility**:
   - Easy to implement as conditional logic based on `use_staging_node`
   - Non-air-gapped deployments keep current Helm-native approach
   - Clear migration path

### Trade-offs Accepted

| Feature Lost | Impact | Mitigation |
|--------------|--------|------------|
| Helm rollback | None | Not used in production |
| Helm history | None | Not used for auditing |
| Helm hooks | Minimal | Scout charts don't rely on critical hooks |
| `--reuse-values` upgrades | Low | Full values always provided in playbooks |
| Release metadata | Low | Deployment state tracked via Ansible, not Helm |

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Simplified air-gapped architecture**: No chart caching layer needed
- **Faster implementation**: ~2 weeks vs ~4-6 weeks for OCI approach
- **Lower operational overhead**: No chart synchronization maintenance
- **Universal compatibility**: Works with any chart format
- **Clear separation of concerns**: Harbor = images, Helm = rendering only

### Negative

- **Manual upgrade complexity**: Can't use `helm upgrade --reuse-values` in air-gapped mode
  - Mitigation: Scout playbooks already provide full values on each deployment
- **No atomic Helm operations**: Apply is not atomic like `helm install --atomic`
  - Mitigation: Can implement retry logic in Ansible playbooks if needed
- **Debugging differences**: Air-gapped deployments won't have Helm release metadata
  - Mitigation: Ansible logs provide deployment tracking; k8s resources have labels

### Neutral

- **Two deployment modes**: Helm-native for non-air-gapped, rendered for air-gapped
  - This is already acceptable given `use_staging_node` flag architecture
  - Both modes tested and maintained via CI/CD

### Implementation Clarifications

**Local Chart Delegation in Non-Air-Gapped Mode:**

While the architecture decision focuses on air-gapped vs non-air-gapped deployment strategies, there is an additional implementation detail for local charts:

- **Local charts** (explorer, hl7log-extractor, hl7-transformer, hive-metastore, dcm4chee, orthanc) **always run on localhost** in both modes
- This is a **physical constraint**, not an architectural choice
- Chart files exist only in `scout_repo_dir` on the Ansible control node
- The deployment wrapper automatically detects local charts (no `helm_repo_name` defined) and delegates to localhost
- Uses `K8S_AUTH_KUBECONFIG` with `local_kubeconfig_yaml` for execution

This ensures:
- **Non-air-gapped mode**: Public charts deploy from cluster nodes (internet access), local charts deploy from control node (where files are)
- **Air-gapped mode**: ALL charts render on control node (localhost) regardless of source

**Registry Mirror Cleanup:**

The implementation includes automatic cleanup of k3s registry mirror configuration:
- When switching from `use_staging_node: true` → `false`, the `/etc/rancher/k3s/registries.yaml` file is automatically removed
- k3s service restarts to apply the change
- Ensures clean state transitions between deployment modes

## Implementation Impact

### Components to Modify

- **New Ansible role**: `helm_renderer` - Reusable chart rendering tasks
- **12 playbooks**: All playbooks using `kubernetes.core.helm` module
- **CI/CD**: Test both deployment modes (air-gapped + non-air-gapped)
- **Documentation**: Update deployment guides with air-gapped instructions

### Estimated Effort

- **Architecture decision**: ✅ Complete (this document)
- **Implementation plan**: ✅ Complete (separate document)
- **Development**: ✅ Complete (2 weeks - created role, refactored all playbooks)
- **Testing**: ⏳ In Progress (validation pending cluster access)
- **Total**: 2 weeks development complete, testing pending

### Helm Hook Analysis

From `temporal/temporal:0.62.0` chart inspection:

```bash
$ grep -r "helm.sh/hook" temporal/
temporal/templates/serviceaccount.yaml:    helm.sh/hook: pre-install, pre-upgrade
temporal/templates/serviceaccount.yaml:    helm.sh/hook-weight: "-10"
# Plus test hooks in subchart dependencies (grafana, prometheus, elasticsearch)
```

**Analysis**:
- ServiceAccount pre-install hook ensures SA exists before pods
- Not functionally required (k8s will wait for SA creation)
- Test hooks only run with `helm test` command (not used in production)
- Schema migration job is NOT a hook (regular Job created by chart)
