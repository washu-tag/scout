# ADR 0011: Real-Time HL7 Listener Architecture

**Date:** 2025-01-09
**Status:** Proposed
**Decision Owner:** TAG Team

## Context

Scout ingests HL7 radiology reports via nightly log files from an IT-managed file mount. The current pipeline:

1. `hl7log-extractor` splits log files on `<SB>`/`<EB>` tags, ZIPs messages, uploads to object storage
2. `hl7-transformer` parses HL7 via manifest file, writes to Delta Lake
3. Results in latency of hours between report availability and Scout ingestion
4. The file mount is unreliable, causing frequent ingestion failures

We have approval to establish a direct HL7 listener connection to the hospital's HL7 interface engine giving us access to ORU^R01 radiology reports and various ADT messages in near real-time.

### Volume

Example message counts from a recent weekday:

| Message Type | Count/Day | Percentage | Description |
|--------------|----------:|------------|-------------|
| **ORU^R01** | 8,439 | 4% | Radiology reports |
| ADT^A08 | 105,846 | 48% | Patient info updates (while admitted) |
| ADT^A31 | 65,034 | 30% | Patient info updates (not admitted) |
| ADT^A04 | 36,650 | 17% | Outpatient registration |
| ADT^A01 | 2,596 | 1% | Inpatient admission |
| ADT^A28 | 700 | <1% | Add person info |
| ADT^A40 | 299 | <1% | Patient merge |
| **Total** | **219,564** | 100% |  |

We must ACK all messages to prevent queue backup (10,000 message limit before interface engine stops sending).

### Challenges

1. **Volume**: ~220k messages/day requires organized storage and filtering
2. **ACK Latency**: Must ACK promptly to avoid upstream queue backup
3. **Report Updates**: Handle status transitions (Preliminary → Final → Corrected)
4. **Patient Merges**: Handling ADT^A40 messages indicate patient record merges
5. **Patient Demographics**: ADT messages contain demographic data not in ORU^R01; scope TBD
6. **Buffering**: Need replay capability without frequent upstream requests

## POC Results

A proof-of-concept validated the Camel K approach with the following components working end-to-end:

| Component | Status | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **hl7-listener** | ✅ Working | Camel K Integration receiving MLLP, parsing HL7, writing to Kafka |
| **Strimzi Kafka** | ✅ Working | Kafka cluster deployed via Strimzi operator with 7-day retention |
| **hl7-batcher** | ✅ Working | Camel K Integration consuming Kafka, batching into ZIPs, uploading to object storage |
| **hl7-test-sender** | ✅ Working | Camel K Integration for development/testing (sends synthetic HL7 messages) |

**Key POC Findings:**

1. **Camel K MLLP works well** - Successfully receives and parses HL7 v2.x messages (tested with v2.7)
2. **Fast ACK achieved** - Listener ACKs after Kafka write, decoupled from downstream processing
3. **Batching via Camel K** - `ZipAggregationStrategy` aggregates messages by count/timeout, uploads to S3
4. **No hl7log-extractor needed** - The hl7-batcher (Camel K) replaces the Kafka→S3 batching function

**POC Architecture Validated:**

                                                                 ▼

```

## Decision

Use Apache Camel K for MLLP listener and message batching, with Kafka as the durable message buffer. The hl7-batcher (Camel K) replaces the batch zipping function previously used in the hl7log-extractor.

### Apache Camel K

Use **Apache Camel K** for the MLLP listener:

- [Camel K](https://github.com/apache/camel-k) is a Kubernetes operator that deploys Camel routes as custom resources
- Define integration as YAML, operator handles container build and deployment
- Built-in MLLP and Kafka components (production-tested)
- No Dockerfile, no Helm chart needed - just apply the Integration CR

### hl7-listener Integration

Receives MLLP messages, writes to Kafka, ACKs immediately. Example route:

```yaml
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: Integration
metadata:
  name: hl7-listener
spec:
  dependencies:
    - camel:mllp
    - camel:hl7
    - camel:kafka
  flows:
    - route:
        id: hl7Listener
        from:
          uri: "mllp://0.0.0.0:2575"
          steps:
            - unmarshal:
                hl7: {}
            - setHeader:
                name: kafka.KEY
                expression:
                  header: CamelHL7MessageControl
            - to:
                uri: "kafka:hl7-messages?brokers={{kafka.brokers}}"
```

### Middleware

Use **Kafka** as durable buffer between listener and extractor:

- Listener writes to Kafka and ACKs immediately (fast ACK, decoupled from downstream)
- 7-day retention enables replay without requesting from upstream
- Use [Strimzi Kafka Operator](https://strimzi.io/) to deploy/manage Kafka in-cluster

### hl7-batcher Integration

Consumes from Kafka, batches messages into ZIPs, uploads to S3, publishes manifest to Kafka:

```yaml
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: Integration
metadata:
  name: hl7-batcher
spec:
  dependencies:
    - camel:kafka
    - camel:aws2-s3
    - camel:zipfile
  traits:
    mount:
      configs:
        - 'secret:hl7-batcher-s3-creds'
  flows:
    - beans:
        - name: zipAggregator
          type: '#class:org.apache.camel.processor.aggregate.zipfile.ZipAggregationStrategy'
          constructors:
            0: false  # preserveFolderStructure
            1: true   # useFilenameHeader
    - route:
        id: batchHl7Messages
        from:
          uri: "kafka:hl7-messages?brokers={{kafka.brokers}}&groupId=hl7-batcher"
          steps:
            - setHeader:
                name: CamelFileName
                expression:
                  simple: '${header.kafka.KEY}-${date:now:yyyyMMddHHmmssSSS}.hl7'
            - aggregate:
                completionSize: 100
                completionTimeout: 30000
                aggregationStrategy: '#zipAggregator'
                correlationExpression:
                  constant: 'true'
                steps:
                  - setHeader:
                      name: CamelAwsS3Key
                      expression:
                        simple: 'hl7-batches/${date:now:yyyy/MM/dd}/batch-${date:now:HHmmssSSS}.zip'
                  - to:
                      uri: "aws2-s3://hl7-raw?..."
                  - to:
                      uri: "kafka:hl7-batches?brokers={{kafka.brokers}}"
```

### Processing Integration

- **hl7-batcher** (Camel K) batches messages into ZIPs, uploads to object storage (Bronze)
- **hl7-batches** Kafka topic receives S3 paths for each uploaded batch
- **hl7-transformer** parses HL7, writes to Delta Lake (Silver) - trigger mechanism TBD
- Delta Lake, Trino, Superset unchanged
- **hl7log-extractor** retained for legacy file-based ingestion (optional)

### Message Type Strategy

| Message | v1 | v2 | v3+ |
|---------|----|----|-----|
| ORU^R01 | Process → Delta Lake | Handle updates (P→F→C) | |
| ADT^A40 | Store raw to `adt_messages` table | | Process → patient ID mapping table |
| Other ADT | Store raw to `adt_messages` table | | Patient info table (TBD) |

ORU messages contain embedded patient demographics (PID segment), so ADT messages are not required for basic patient info.

ADT messages stored in v1 with `message_dt` timestamp to preserve ordering for future processing. ADT^A40 (merges) will require a patient ID mapping table to maintain accurate historical queries. Other ADT messages may inform a dedicated patient or demographic table in the future; further research needed on exact contents of each ADT type.

## Alternatives Considered

| Option | Verdict |
|--------|---------|
| **Apache Camel K + Kafka (selected)** | Kubernetes-native, YAML-based routes, built-in MLLP + Kafka, durable buffer with replay |
| hl7-to-kafka (or fork) | Some code to write/maintain, need to publish images and create helm chart |
| python-hl7 mllp to Kafka | More code to write/maintain, need to publish images and create helm chart  |
| Direct to object storage | Too many small writes, slows ACKs |
| Listener to file system | Too many small writes, slows ACKs |

### Cloud Deployment

Running the HL7 listener in the cloud (e.g., Azure) would provide durability benefits:

- **Higher availability** than on-prem K3s cluster which experiences periodic outages
- **Isolated infrastructure** reduces risk of local network issues affecting HL7 ingestion

However, our air-gapped deployment prevents this approach. The on-prem network cannot be opened to external cloud services.

## Architecture

### Component Overview

```
HL7 Source ──► hl7-listener ──► Kafka ──► hl7-batcher ──► Object Storage (Bronze)
   (MLLP)      (Camel K)     (hl7-messages) (Camel K)           │
                    │                                            ▼

                                                                 ▼
                                                          hl7-transformer
                                                           (trigger TBD)
                                                                 │
                                                                 ▼
                                                          Delta Lake (Silver)
```

| Component | Type | Lifecycle | Purpose |
|-----------|------|-----------|---------|
| hl7-listener | Camel K Integration | Runs continuously | Receive MLLP, write to Kafka, ACK |
| Kafka | Message broker (Strimzi) | Runs continuously | Durable buffer, 7-day retention |
| hl7-batcher | Camel K Integration | Runs continuously | Batch messages into ZIPs, upload to S3 (Bronze), publish manifest |
| hl7-transformer | Python/Spark | TBD | Parse HL7, write to Delta Lake (Silver) |

### Changes to Existing Scout Components

| Component | Change Required |
|-----------|-----------------|
| hl7log-extractor | No changes needed for real-time flow; retained for legacy file-based ingestion |
| hl7-transformer | Trigger mechanism TBD (see hl7-transformer Integration section); write ADT messages to `adt_messages` table |
| Delta Lake schema | Add `adt_messages` table for raw ADT storage; future phases add patient_id_mapping table |

### hl7-transformer Integration (Investigation Required)

The hl7-batcher publishes batch manifest paths to Kafka (`hl7-batches` topic). A mechanism is needed to trigger the hl7-transformer to process these batches. Options under investigation:

| Option | Description | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------------|------|------|
| **Spark Structured Streaming** | Transformer runs continuously, consumes from Kafka | Low latency, eliminates Temporal | Always-running job, requires refactor |
| **Temporal + Kafka Trigger** | Kafka consumer triggers Temporal workflow | Minimal transformer changes | Additional component, higher latency |
| **Kubernetes CronJob** | Scheduled job triggers transformer | Simple, no new dependencies | Fixed latency, not event-driven |
| **Camel K → Temporal API** | Camel K route triggers Temporal | Keeps logic in Camel K | Still requires Temporal |

**Recommendation:** Further investigation required. The choice depends on whether to keep or eliminate Temporal from the real-time ingestion flow.

## Database End State

### The Problem

**Report Updates:** Same report arrives multiple times as status changes:

```
08:00  ORU^R01  Report 123  Status: P (Preliminary)
08:30  ORU^R01  Report 123  Status: F (Final)
09:00  ORU^R01  Report 123  Status: C (Corrected)
```

**Patient Merges:** ADT^A40 messages indicate two patient records have been merged:

```
ADT^A40: Patient 78901 merged into Patient 78900
→ Historical reports filed under 78901 are orphaned
→ Query for Patient 78900 misses historical data
```

### Phased Approach

**v1: Accept Duplicate Reports , Ignore ADTs (current state)**

- Ingest all ORU^R01 messages as new rows
- Users may see multiple rows per report (Preliminary, Final, Corrected versions)

**v2: Handle Report Updates**

- Add `reports_latest` view with status hierarchy (Corrected > Final > Preliminary)
- Users query view for current report version, base table for full history

**v3: Handle Patient Merges**

- New table: `patient_id_mapping` populated from ADT^A40 messages
- Maps old MRN → surviving MRN with effective date
- Views and queries join through mapping table for accurate patient-centric results

**Future: Patient Info Table**

- Dedicated table for patient demographics sourced from ADT messages
- Separate from reports table, linked by patient identifiers
- Scope TBD - need to research exact contents of ADT^A08, A31, A04, A01, A28

## Production Considerations

### High Availability

| Component | HA Strategy |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Kafka** | Deploy with replication factor ≥ 2; Strimzi handles broker failover |
| **hl7-listener** | Can run multiple replicas; Kafka handles dedup via message key |
| **hl7-batcher** | Single replica recommended (aggregation state); or partition-based sharding via consumer groups |
| **hl7-transformer** | Depends on trigger mechanism; Spark Structured Streaming or Temporal provide their own HA |

### Monitoring & Alerting

- **Kafka lag monitoring** - Alert if consumer falls behind (indicates processing bottleneck)
- **hl7-listener health** - Camel K provides `/health` endpoint; integrate with K8s probes
- **S3 upload metrics** - Track success/failure rates, latency
- **End-to-end latency** - Track time from message receipt to Delta Lake availability
- **Integration with Grafana/Prometheus** - Use existing Scout monitoring stack

### Failure Recovery

| Scenario | Recovery |
|----------|----------|
| **hl7-listener restart** | Kafka durability; no message loss if written before ACK |
| **hl7-batcher restart** | Aggregation state lost, but consumer resumes from last committed offset |
| **S3 upload failure** | Retry logic in Camel route; idempotent uploads (same key overwrites) |
| **hl7-transformer failure** | Depends on trigger; Delta Lake MERGE handles duplicate processing |
| **Kafka broker failure** | Strimzi handles failover; 7-day retention enables replay |

### Scaling

- **Current volume**: ~2-3 msg/sec sustained, ~40 msg/sec burst - well within single instance capacity
- **Kafka partitions** control parallelism for consumers
- **Multiple hl7-listener replicas** for throughput (if needed)
- **hl7-batcher scaling** via Kafka consumer groups (one consumer per partition)

### Security

- **Kafka TLS** - Strimzi supports TLS for client connections
- **S3 credentials** - Kubernetes secrets mounted via Camel K `mount.configs` trait
- **Network policies** - Restrict pod-to-pod communication to required paths

### Backup & Disaster Recovery

- **Kafka retention** - 7 days of message history for replay
- **S3/MinIO** - Backed up per existing Scout policies
- **Delta Lake** - Versioning provides point-in-time recovery

### Automated Testing

Independent of hospital test environment, we need automated tests that run in CI/CD:

| Test Type | Scope | Environment |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Unit tests** | Camel route logic, message parsing | Local/CI |
| **Integration tests** | hl7-listener → Kafka → hl7-batcher flow | Test Kafka cluster |
| **End-to-end tests** | Full flow with synthetic HL7 messages | Dev K8s cluster |
| **Load tests** | Verify performance at expected volumes | Dev K8s cluster |
| **Failure tests** | Component restarts, network partitions | Dev K8s cluster |

Test infrastructure:
- **hl7-test-sender** (Camel K) generates synthetic HL7 messages for testing
- Dedicated test Kafka topics to isolate from production
- Assertions on Kafka message counts, S3 object presence, Delta Lake row counts

## Open Questions

- [ ] ADT message contents - what exactly is in A08, A31, A04, A01, A28?
- [ ] Patient info table schema - what fields are needed beyond what ORU PID segment provides?
- [ ] Test environment - when available? how to schedule testing?
- [ ] Alerting - who should receive incident alerts?
- [ ] hl7-transformer trigger mechanism - which option to pursue?

## Test Plan

### Goal

Validate end-to-end message flow before production deployment.

### POC Validation (Complete)

- [x] Deploy Camel K operator to cluster
- [x] Deploy Strimzi Kafka operator and cluster
- [x] Create Kafka topics: `hl7-messages`, `hl7-batches`
- [x] Apply `hl7-listener` Integration CR
- [x] Apply `hl7-batcher` Integration CR
- [x] Apply `hl7-test-sender` Integration CR (for testing)
- [x] Validate message flow: listener → Kafka → batcher → S3 → Kafka manifest

### Internal Testing (Pending)

- [ ] Automated unit tests for Camel K integrations
- [ ] Integration tests with test Kafka cluster
- [ ] End-to-end tests with synthetic HL7 messages
- [ ] Failure scenario tests (component restarts, network issues)
- [ ] Performance/load testing with expected message volumes

### Hospital Test Environment (Pending)

- [ ] Connect hl7-listener to hospital test HL7 feed
- [ ] Validate message flow with real HL7 messages:
  - Messages received and ACKs sent correctly
  - No upstream queue backup
  - Messages appear in Kafka with correct parsing
  - Batcher creates ZIPs with proper structure
  - ZIPs written to object storage
- [ ] Validate end-to-end to Delta Lake (requires hl7-transformer integration)
- [ ] Test failure scenarios:
  - Listener restart - verify no message loss (Kafka durability)
  - Batcher restart - verify Kafka replay works
  - Transformer failure - verify retry mechanism works

### Success Criteria

- All messages ACK'd promptly (no upstream queue backup)
- ORU data lands in Delta Lake with correct parsing
- System recovers from component restarts without data loss
- End-to-end latency within acceptable range (minutes, not hours)

## Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Camel MLLP edge cases | Low | High | Thorough testing with real messages; fallback to hl7-to-kafka (or fork) |
| Kafka operational complexity | Medium | Medium | Document runbooks |
| On-prem infrastructure outages | Medium | High | Kafka provides buffering; request replay as last resort |
| ADT^A40 merge complexity | High | Medium | Defer to v3; research thoroughly before implementing |
