# ADR 0025: In-App User Administration and Launchpad Token Pass-Through

**Date**: 2026-06-05
**Status**: Accepted
**Decision Owner**: TAG Team

## Context

ADR 0020 makes per-user Trino access attribute-driven: a Scout user's row
filters and column masks come from Keycloak User Profile attributes
(`allowed_facilities`, `redact_select_identifiers`, `bypass_hidden_tables`, ...), rendered
from `trino_attribute_filters`. Granting a new user access therefore means two
manual Keycloak master-admin-console steps — add them to `scout-user`, then
hand-edit each attribute on their user detail page. We have no upstream IdP data
to automate the decision, so a human stays in the loop; but the console workflow
is error-prone (free-text attributes, no validation, easy to miss a step) and
needs master-admin access. We want to make the approver's job easier without
weakening the authorization model.

This started as an approval-only UI and has since grown into the primary surface
for **user administration**: beyond approving pending users, an admin can edit an
existing user's data-access attributes, promote/demote `scout-admin`, and offboard
(revoke all Scout access). Keycloak remains available for power users, but the
launchpad is the main touch-point, so the standalone Keycloak "Users" tile is
removed from the launchpad home.

## Decision

A purpose-built **user-administration console in the launchpad**, backed by a
small **Keycloak REST resource**, with **dynamic, config-driven attributes**.

### 1. scout-users REST resource (Keycloak SPI)

A `RealmResourceProvider` in the existing event-listener SPI exposes a
`scout-admin`-gated API under `/realms/<realm>/scout-users/`. Every call is
authenticated with `BearerTokenAuthenticator` and authorized by a live
`scout-admin` group check; there is no standing admin-API credential, so the
resource acts on the authenticated admin's own authority. As defense in depth on
an API that can grant `scout-admin` -> realm-admin, it also
requires the bearer to carry `aud=scout-users-api` (added by the launchpad client's
audience mapper), so a `scout-admin`'s token minted for another resource — e.g. an
`aud=trino` notebook token — can't reach it. The endpoints:

- `GET /schema` — the data-access attributes to collect, **discovered at request
  time** from the realm User Profile (attributes annotated `scoutAuthz=true`,
  themselves rendered from `trino_attribute_filters`). Each carries a widget hint
  (`inputType`), allowed `options`, and a safe `scoutDefault`.
- `GET /pending` — users who accepted the Terms of Use but aren't yet in
  `scout-user`.
- `GET /users?status=&search=` — the admin table: each user's derived status
  (pending / active / admin), admin flag, and **only** their `scoutAuthz`
  attributes — never the raw attribute map, so `scout_terms_accepted_at` and the
  approval-email marker don't leak to the client.
- `POST /approve` — validate the submitted attributes against the schema, set
  them, and join `scout-user`.
- `POST /users/{id}/attributes` — edit an approved user's data-access attributes
  (reuses the approve validation; no group change).
- `POST` / `DELETE /users/{id}/admin` — promote / demote `scout-admin`.
- `DELETE /users/{id}/membership` — offboard: remove `scout-user` **and**
  `scout-admin` (full revocation; the user falls back to Pending).

Because the schema is discovered, **adding an authorization dimension stays the
one-line inventory edit ADR 0020 promised**: the new attribute flows into the
form and its server-side validation with no code change here. Safe defaults are
config-driven too (`scoutDefault`: `redact_select_identifiers=true`,
`bypass_hidden_tables=false`).

**Guardrails** (package-private predicates, mutation-tested, enforced server-side
regardless of the UI):

- *No self-offboard* — an admin can't revoke their own access (almost always an
  accident). Self-*demote* is allowed (a privilege drop). Demoting or offboarding
  the last `scout-admin` is **not** specially guarded: recovery is the same
  Keycloak master-console bootstrap that seeds the first admin, so a deliberate
  lockout isn't worth the check.
- *Attribute-key allowlist* — only `scoutAuthz` keys may be written, and the whole
  submission is validated before anything is set, so a bad request never
  half-applies.

The launchpad proxy and the UI's confirm dialogs are convenience only; a `curl`
with a valid `scout-admin` token skips them, so only these server-side checks are
load-bearing.

### 1a. Propagation: every mutation emits a Keycloak admin event

The SPI mutates the user model directly (`joinGroup` / `setAttribute`), which —
unlike a change made through Keycloak's admin REST API — fires **no admin event**.
But both consumers of user changes react *only* to admin events: the OPA bundle
publisher (ADR 0021) re-snapshots a user on a `USER` / `GROUP_MEMBERSHIP` event,
and the approval/offboard email listener keys off `scout-user` in a
group-membership event. So every mutating endpoint explicitly emits a
correctly-shaped `AdminEvent` (`resourcePath users/{id}/...`) after the model
change, built from the calling admin's `AuthResult`.

Without this an approved user would sit in `scout-user` in Keycloak yet be denied
every row by OPA until an unrelated admin event or a Keycloak restart re-seeded
the bundle — a latent defect in the approval-only proof-of-concept, fixed here.
The tested core methods stay event-free; emission lives in the thin JAX-RS
adapters.

### 1b. Console vs Keycloak boundary

The launchpad console owns the `scout-user` / `scout-admin` lifecycle and the
data-access attributes. Keycloak stays the escape hatch for everything else:
account **enable/disable** (deliberately out of scope — `enabled` is not a
`scoutAuthz` attribute, so it never appears in the form), **first-admin
bootstrap**, and realm / client / IdP / SMTP configuration. A fresh realm is
**console-locked** until the first `scout-admin` is granted in the Keycloak master
console — every console endpoint is `scout-admin`-gated. The in-console "Open in Keycloak" link and the
Keycloak admin-events log (the recommended audit trail) reach Keycloak for power
users.

**Blast radius (accepted).** `scout-admin` maps to `realm-management/realm-admin`,
so in-UI promotion hands over full Keycloak realm-admin, not just Scout-app admin.
This is accepted for the current trust model — a single admin can promote another,
no dual-control. Narrowing what `scout-admin` grants, or requiring a second
approver on promote, is left as future work.

**A leaked launchpad token.** The launchpad client is `fullScopeAllowed=false`, so
its tokens carry only its own client roles (`launchpad-admin`/`launchpad-user`) —
`clientScopeMappings` keep those two so the `isAdmin` gate still resolves — not the
user's realm roles. A leaked launchpad token, even a `scout-admin`'s, is therefore
**not** a `realm-admin` credential against the Keycloak admin REST API (it 403s
there), and its `aud: scout-users-api` means it is not a Trino data token either.
That removes the *direct* admin-API path — but it does not contain the credential:

- *Console power is unchanged* — a stolen `scout-admin` token still passes the live
  group check and still carries the right audience (the flag filters roles, not
  audiences or group membership), so it drives every endpoint directly — offboard
  users, rewrite anyone's data-access attributes, promote/demote — no escalation
  needed.
- *Self-service is gated only by account control* — if the thief controls an
  account they can authenticate as (their own, or a pending identity brokered in
  via the IdP), one `approve` with `allowed_facilities=*` / `redact_select_identifiers=false`
  grants *themselves* full unmasked data access, and a self-promote re-mints a
  `realm-admin` token from another full-scope client (e.g. the built-in
  `admin-cli`). The SPI cannot create users or set passwords and self-registration
  is off, so a thief who controls **no** account of their own can disrupt other
  users' access but — lacking any account to grant or promote — cannot gain access
  themselves.

So `fullScopeAllowed=false` is worth keeping — it stops a stolen token from being a
turnkey realm-admin credential and forces any escalation through the audited
`approve`/promote path — but it is hardening on the **leaked-credential** axis, not
a barrier to escalation or data access once an attacker controls an account (the
accepted blast radius above). The standing exposure is removed by the server-side
session store (see *Token storage note*).

### 2. UI in the launchpad

The console lives in the launchpad (Next.js + Tailwind + next-auth) at
`/admin/users`, not as Keycloak-served HTML, reusing the launchpad's existing
auth, styling, and admin gating. One users table with a Pending | Active | Admins
filter; clicking a row opens a slide-over drawer that is a **dual-mode editor** —
approve a pending user (form seeded from schema defaults) or manage an existing
one (pre-filled with their current attributes), with promote/demote and offboard
behind confirm prompts that surface the server's 409 rather than assuming success.
The admin approval email deep-links to `…/admin/users?user=<id>`. The page and its
Admin Tools tile gate on `session.user.isAdmin` — the `launchpad-admin` client
role that the `scout-admin` group grants — so the UI gate matches the role
Keycloak already issues. The KC API remains the real gate (defense in depth).

### 3. Token pass-through (not impersonation, not exchange)

The browser never holds the Keycloak token. A launchpad **server-side route**
(`/api/users/*`) mints a fresh access token from the admin's next-auth session
and forwards it as the Bearer to the scout-users API — **same-realm JWT
pass-through**, the model [ADR 0022](0022-trino-auth-and-impersonation.md) uses
for JupyterHub. This fits the launchpad because, like Jupyter's Hub, it has a
**fresh-user-token source**: next-auth is the custodian, holding the refresh
token and renewing server-side. (The impersonation clients — Superset, Voila,
the Open WebUI MCP — use `X-Trino-User` precisely because they lack such a
source; the launchpad does not need to.) There is **no token exchange** (unlike the
closed XNAT token-exchange POC, #410).

Keeping the bearer valid is simple because refresh-token rotation is off in the
realm: the proxy mints a fresh access token from the stored refresh token on
every request (nothing is cached), and the refresh token stays reusable for the
SSO session. A dead-session 401 from Keycloak (e.g. after a Keycloak redeploy)
surfaces a re-login prompt in the console, distinguished from a 403 — the reactive
half of [ADR 0024](0024-sdk-trino-token-refresh.md)'s refresh shape (per-request
minting removes any need for proactive caching). The route is a catch-all
(`[...path]`) over `GET`/`POST`/`DELETE` with a per-method allowlist of path
shapes, so it forwards the sub-resourced verbs without becoming an open proxy.

**Token storage note.** The session cookie holds **no access token** — just the
refresh token plus the small `username`/`isAdmin` fields — JWE-encrypted with
`NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, `httpOnly`, `secure` —
and the `/api/users` proxy mints a fresh access token from it per request. The
access token can't also live in the cookie: an admin's carried dozens of roles
(the launchpad client was `fullScopeAllowed` by default), which pushed the
(chunked) cookie past the browser/proxy size limit and intermittently dropped the
session (a real bug hit in testing). An access-token-*only* cookie isn't an option
either — next-auth needs the refresh token to renew the session, so without it the
session would die at the ~5-minute access-token mark.

**Trade-off (accepted).** The refresh token is the longer-lived credential — with
rotation off it stays reusable for the ~8h SSO session — so it is worse-on-leak
than a short-lived access token would be. This is not introduced here: the
launchpad's next-auth has stored access **and** refresh tokens in this cookie
since it adopted Keycloak login. This feature is the first to *use* a stored token
(for the proxy) and in doing so **shrank** the cookie — dropping the access token
entirely and the `groups` array, leaving the refresh token plus the small
`username`/`isAdmin` fields. The exposure is
gated by `httpOnly` + `secure` + JWE (extraction needs both cookie theft *and*
`NEXTAUTH_SECRET`); `fullScopeAllowed=false` keeps a stolen token from being a
turnkey realm-admin credential but does not contain it (see *A leaked launchpad
token*, above). The hardening that actually removes it is a
**server-side session store**: the browser holds only an opaque session id — no
token material at all — and sessions become server-side revocable. Tracked as a
launchpad-wide follow-up, since it improves the pre-existing session model rather
than anything this feature added.

## Consequences

- User administration is one validated console — approve, edit attributes,
  promote/demote, offboard — instead of several hand-edits in the Keycloak master
  console, and without master-admin access.
- The first `scout-admin` is still seeded out-of-band in the Keycloak master
  console (the realm is console-locked until then); the console manages the
  `scout-user` / `scout-admin` lifecycle from there on.
- Every SPI mutation now emits an admin event, so OPA propagation and the
  approval/offboard emails work for SPI-driven changes — they silently did not
  before (see *Propagation*, above).
- Offboard is full revocation (both groups), so there is never an "offboarded but
  still realm-admin" state; an offboarded user reappears under Pending (Terms
  still accepted), not deleted.
- The launchpad reuses ADR 0022's JWT pass-through but forwards the user's token
  to Keycloak's `scout-users` API instead of to Trino — a new identity-propagation
  path on the same model.
- The UI admin gate (`session.user.isAdmin`) is login-time, so a user
  demoted/offboarded via the console keeps the admin affordances until they sign
  in again (it is resolved from the profile at login and never re-derived mid-
  session); the SPI's live `scout-admin` check still rejects every call in the
  meantime, so this is a stale affordance, not an access path.
- The audit trail is the Keycloak admin-events log (reached via "Open in
  Keycloak"); shipping actions to an external immutable store is future work.
- The initial proof-of-concept (a Keycloak-SPI-served HTML page + a public PKCE
  client) is retired in favor of the launchpad page.
