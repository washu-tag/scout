# Integration Tests

Integration tests for Scout are available within the [tests](../../tests) directory within the root of the repository. The tests are built
using [gradle](https://gradle.org/) and can be launched with the gradle wrapper script with a Java 21 JDK available:

```bash
$ cd tests
$ ./gradlew clean test
```

## Configuration

The tests require a JSON configuration file stored within `src/test/resources/config`. The configuration uses JSON
for compatibility with complex configuration requirements. If the name of a config file is passed to gradle with
`-Dconfig=<config name>`, the configuration will be read from the specified file. If it is left out, the tests will
attempt to load a default config in a `local.json`. The JSON configuration corresponds to a serialized version of
[TestConfig.java](../../tests/src/test/java/edu/washu/tag/TestConfig.java). Currently, the root-level properties are:
* `sparkConfig`: a dictionary that is passed as-is to spark in order to connect to the delta lake.
* `deltaLakeUrl`: the URL for the delta lake to be tested.
