There is no\nevidence of acute fracture or subluxation. The alignment maintains\nnormal lordotic curvature without pathological kyphosis. The facet\njoints at multiple levels demonstrate hypertrophic changes, and there\nis mild narrowing of the neural foramina bilaterally at C5-C6,\npotentially impinging on exiting nerve roots. No soft tissue swelling\nis noted anterior to the cervical vertebrae. The prevertebral soft\ntissue thickness remains within normal limits. The odontoid process\nis intact and well visualized.\n\n\nIMPRESSION:\nSignificant cervical spondylosis with marked degenerative disc\ndisease predominantly at C5-C6 and C6-C7 levels, accompanied by\nanterior osteophytosis and facet joint hypertrophy producing mild\nforaminal narrowing bilaterally. These degenerative alterations align\nwith chronic cervical spine degenerative pathology, consistent with\nclinical symptoms such as radiculopathy or neck pain. The lack of\nacute bony injury or alignment abnormality excludes recent trauma.\nContinued clinical correlation and consideration of advanced imaging\nmay be warranted depending on symptomatology.\nDictated by: Latasha Long Interpreter, M.D.",
